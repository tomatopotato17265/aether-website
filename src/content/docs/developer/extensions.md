# Extensions Guide

> **Current status:** `.aex` extensions and the Goja backend API described below are implemented. An `.aex` file is a zip-format package with an Aether-specific file extension; standard `.zip` packages are not the supported user-facing install format. The Aether CLI and SDK are published as sibling projects. Install the CLI with `go install github.com/wayback09/aether-cli@latest` and the SDK with `npm install --save-dev @aethermc/sdk`.

## Architecture Overview
Aether extensions operate in two distinct, isolated layers:
1. **The Backend Sandbox (`main.js`)**: Runs in Aether's secure, headless Goja engine. It has no DOM access, but can interact with Aether's native Go APIs (e.g., to patch instances or read files, based on requested permissions).
2. **The Frontend UI (`ui/index.html`)**: Runs in the Aether Svelte app as a secure `<iframe>`. Aether spins up a lightweight local HTTP server to serve these files.

## How to Build an Extension

1. Create a new directory for your extension.
2. Create a `manifest.json`.
3. Write your `main.js` backend entry point.
4. Create a `ui` folder containing your `index.html` and any CSS/JS.
5. Use the `Aether.ui` API in your backend script to register your interface.

```javascript
// main.js
Aether.ui.registerSidebarPage({
    id: "my-custom-page",
    label: "My Page",
    url: "ui/index.html" // Points to your HTML file relative to your extension folder
});
```

## Packaging and Installation

We recommend using a rich package structure to give your extension a professional presentation:

```text
my-extension.aex
├── manifest.json
├── main.js
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── icon.png
├── ui/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── assets/
```

**Installation**: Users install `.aex` packages from the Extensions page or through the Extension Gallery. An `.aex` package uses the zip container format internally, but the launcher treats `.aex` as the supported extension package type. In development, an extracted extension folder may be placed directly in Aether's data directory under `extensions`; the launcher uses a local `.aether` directory when present, otherwise it uses the platform configuration directory.

## Manifest
Every extension requires a `manifest.json` at its root.
```json
{
  "id": "com.example.myextension",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "Adds a cool new feature to Aether.",
  "main": "main.js",
  "api": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "ui:sidebar",
    "instances:list",
    "mods:install"
  ]
}
```

### Optional Registry Metadata

The registry may also store metadata such as compatibility ranges and project links:

```json
{
  "minApi": "1.0",
  "maxApi": "2.0",
  "homepage": "https://example.com/myextension",
  "repository": "https://github.com/example/myextension",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["mods", "fabric"]
}
```

These fields are retained for registry and future tooling use. The current launcher does not enforce API ranges or consume the project metadata when loading an extension.

## Permissions
Extensions operate under a principle of least privilege. You must explicitly request access to APIs.
- `ui:sidebar`: Register sidebar pages that render your `ui/index.html` in an iframe.
- `ui:dialogs`: Exposes the current dialog stub; a functional dialog API is planned.
- `instances:list`: List installed instances.
- `mods:list`: List mods in an instance.
- `mods:install`: Install a mod after launcher confirmation.
- `mods:delete`: Delete a mod after launcher confirmation.
- `mods:toggle`: Enable or disable a mod after launcher confirmation.
- `network:http`: Make backend HTTP GET requests to allowed hosts.
- `fs:download`: Download files to the shared `libraries` directory.
- `launcher:modloader`: Register a launch-time mod-loader callback.
- `skin:export`: Write base64 data below the shared `skins` directory.
- `discord:presence`: Update Discord Rich Presence via `Aether.discord.setActivity` / `clearActivity` and subscribe to `Aether.events.on('instance:state')`.

The legacy `instances:patch` permission remains supported for migration and grants the current instance/mod capabilities. New extensions should use the granular permissions above.

## Extension UI Rules
Because extension UIs run inside an `<iframe>`, you have complete control over your DOM. You can use React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit, or plain HTML/CSS. Aether is completely **framework-agnostic**.

However, to maintain a consistent user experience, we recommend matching Aether's dark, frosted-glass aesthetic.

## Examples
Check the `extensions-src/` directory in the Aether repository for complete sample extensions, including the Modrinth Browser and the Fabric mod loader.

## Trust Tiers
The Aether Registry may assign trust metadata. The launcher displays these badges, but the labels do not replace code review or provide a local security guarantee:

1. 🔵 **Official**: Developed and maintained directly by the Aether Team.
2. 🟢 **Verified**: Personally reviewed by an Aether maintainer. The code has been thoroughly audited for security, performance, and stability.
3. 🟣 **Community**: Passed automated checks and was merged into the registry via Pull Request, but has not received a manual code audit. Use with caution.
4. 🟡 **Local**: Installed manually from a `.aex` file. These are Local unless the manifest ID matches a registry entry, in which case the registry trust tier is displayed.

The registry's planned review process would consider:
1. **No Malicious Code**: Extensions must not steal tokens, install malware, or attempt to break out of the Goja sandbox.
2. **Performance**: Extensions must not leak memory or block the main thread.
3. **Clear Purpose**: The extension must do exactly what its description claims.

## Developer Experience (Aether CLI)

The Aether CLI (`aether-cli-cli`) is the official toolkit for creating, developing, testing, packaging, validating, and publishing Aether extensions. The goal is a new developer can go from nothing to a working extension in under five minutes.

In the local development workspace, the related repositories are:

- `$WORKSPACE/Aether-Cli`
- `$WORKSPACE/Aether-SDK`
- `$WORKSPACE/Aether-Extensions`

### Project Creation

```
aether-cli init
```

Starts an interactive folder generator. You will be asked:

- **Extension Name**
- **Extension ID** (e.g. `com.example.my-extension`)
- **Author**
- **Version**
- **Description**
- **License**
- **Extension Type**: Feature or Appearance Pack
- **Framework**: Vanilla, React, Vue, Svelte, or Solid
- **Homepage** *(optional)*
- **Repository URL** *(optional)*

Scaffolds the following structure:

```
my-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── src/
│   └── main.js
├── ui/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.js
│   └── styles.css
├── assets/
└── .gitignore
```

> **Note**: Choosing a framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid) scaffolds a Vite build config inside `ui/` and requires a build step before the extension runs. Vanilla skips the build step entirely.

---

### Development

```
aether dev
```

Watches source files and hot-reloads the extension. Requires an active Aether instance to be running — if one is not detected, the command will print an error and exit rather than silently doing nothing. Shows extension logs, API calls, permission usage, and runtime errors with source maps.

---

### Validation

```
aether-cli validate
```

Checks manifest syntax, missing files, invalid permissions, API compatibility, version format, duplicate IDs, invalid assets, missing icons, and missing metadata. Returns a clear pass/fail with specific error messages.

---

### Packaging

```
aether-cli build
```

Produces a `my-extension.aex` file. Automatically minifies, compresses, validates, generates a checksum, and strips development files. The `.aex` format is Aether's first-class extension container. It is zip-compatible internally, but `.zip` is not the supported package extension for launcher installs.

---

### Testing

```
aether test
```

Runs optional API mocks, permission tests, UI snapshot tests, manifest validation, and integration tests.

---

### Version Management

```
aether version patch
aether version minor
aether version major
```

Automatically updates `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and `CHANGELOG`.
